# Contribution guidelines

In order to make sure that everyone involved in the project have good experience contributing, we have some guidelines which we would like you to follow:

- Do you have a suggestion how to improve the project or you found a bug? Create a Github issue with that. Don't be afraid of writing down your ideas! Make sure you describe it as best as you can and add a schema / image / gif if it helps you to express yourself better. Try to keep the context small as well. 
- Do you have a question about an existing issue? Ask creator by talking to her directly or by adding a comment in the issue. We are all learning here, so questions are always welcome!
- You don't know where to start? Assign an issue to you and start working on it :) For that, we would advise to:
  - Create a new branch locally with the issue number + title
  - Try to solve the issue. Try to name things clearly (again, feel free to discuss it with someone if needed) and take your time to solve your problem, we are not in a rush :)
  - Do regular commits of your development
  - Add unit tests :D
  - Push your changes to your branch at the end of each hack night. If you are not finished, add a description of what's done / what's missing so that someone can pick it up from there next time in case you can't attend
  - Create a pull request (make sure all tests pass before). Describe in the pull request what you have done and what problem your solution solves
- Are you a reviewer?
  - Verify that all tests pass
  - Check if the pull request solves the problem
  - Check code readability and add comments if you have some suggestions or you don't understand something
- Have fun!
